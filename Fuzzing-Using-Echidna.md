What is Fuzzing? 
- Testing a massive number of random scenarios to find out values that produce unexpected results. 

Supporting Tools for Echidna:

Slither: https://github.com/crytic/slither
- Slither is a Solidity static analysis framework written in Python 3. It runs a suite of vulnerabilitie detectors, prints visual information about contract details, 
and provides an PI to write custom analysis. 
- This enables developers to find vulnerabilities, enhance their code comprehension, and quickly prototype custom analyses

Crytic-compile: https://github.com/crytic/crytic-compile
- Crytic-compile is a library to help smart contract compilation with support for most major development frameworks
